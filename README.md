## Assignment 1:  Truth-table and circuits for sign activation 
hh

## Assignment 2: One-Time Truth-Table (OTTT), passive
An implementation of a secure two-party protocol for computing the function specified in Equation 1 using the passively secure One-Time Truth-Table (OTTT) protocol.

## Assignment 3: BeDOZa protocol, passive
An implementation of the passively secure BeDOZa protocol for computing the function specified in Equation 2.

## Assignment 4: BeDOZa protocol, active (malicious) adversary
An enhancement of our implementation of the BeDOZa protocol (assignments 3). It provides security against malicious adversaries (security with abort) by using MACs to authenticate secret shares.

## Assignment 5: BeDOZa protocol with a general functionality
An extension of our implementation of the BeDOZa protocol (assignments 3-4) to general functionality.

## Assignment 6: Oblivious Transfer to Replace Dealer
Elimination of the need for the dealer in BeDOZa protocol we implemented in assignment 4 using a 1-out-of-n OT protocol against active adversaries.

## Assignment 7: Garbled Circuits
An implementation of Yaoâ€™s protocol for the Boolean circuit evaluating Equation 2.

## Assignment 8: Homormorphic Encryption
